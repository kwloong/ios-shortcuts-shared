## iOS Shortcuts


### Show Overdue And Not Completed Reminders From All

This simple shortcut searches through all your reminders and selects those that are _Overdue_ and _not marked as Completed_ . They are assigned to a variable then passed to Quick Look, but you can easily modify and use this list for other purposes.

~~As of iOS 15.5, I can't find a direct filter for Reminder related Shortcuts action that allows filtering by current date, so had to iterate through the reminders instead.~~

Two ways:

1. A simple 3 action approach as follows:

![Show_Overdue_And_Not_Completed_Reminders_From_All Simple Shortcut screenshot](Show_Overdue_And_Not_Completed_Reminders_From_All/Show_Overdue_And_Not_Completed_Reminders_From_All_shortcut_screen_simple.JPG)


2. A complicated way that iterates through "not completed" reminders to extract those that are also overdue. For adding further differentiated actions in the loop if needed.

The shortcut as follows, you can also find the ".shortcut" [file](Show_Overdue_And_Not_Completed_Reminders_From_All/Show_Overdue_And_Not_Completed_Reminders_From_All.shortcut) in this repo.

It runs without needing to accept any input.


## FAQs

**Q: These are simple things Why is this Readme so lengthy? Why do you need to put this online even?**

**Q: Why is there even an FAQ for this??**

**A:** Because.
